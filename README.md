**How Does Heatspace Portable Heater Work?**

Heatspace Heater works like other space heaters sold online today. It simply converts electrical energy into heat energy and uses that heat to warm the air around it.

This infrared heat is a radiant type of heat that warms up objects and people directly without heating up the air. This makes the Heatspace Portable Heater more efficient and effective than other heaters which make use of or rely on convection heat.
